      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.7-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Support for implicit matrix, contributed by Jiali Mei.
      User can supply a function FUN rather than an explicit matrix
      to eigs(), and the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of this operator
      will be computed. FUN(x, args) must return a vector of the same
      length as x.

    o eigs() will test the symmetry of matrix before actual computation,
      since symmetric matrices can guarantee real eigenvalues and
      eigenvectors, and the numerical result is more stable.

BUG FIXES

    o C++ code of svds() is completely rewritten. Now it is more readable
      and easier to maintain.

    o Fix a bug possibly coming from ARPACK, which sometimes gives
      incorrect result of complex eigenvectors.

    o Avoid using a C random number generator.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.6-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Add support for new matrix types: dgeMatrix and dgRMatrix.

    o eigs() now allows a full Eigen Decomposition, meaning that
      all the eigenvalues are calculated. In this case eigs() is
      simply a wrapper of eigen(), and with a warning issued.

    o Ditto for svds()

BUG FIXES

    o Rewrite C++ code using classes and templates.

    o Fix errors in checking the values of k and ncv.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.5-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Add svds() function to calculate truncated SVD.

BUG FIXES

    o Now sort eigenvalues in decreasing order.

    o Rename eigs.sym() to eigs_sym() to avoid confusion.

    o Fix a matrix out-of-bound error.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.4-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Implement shift-and-invert mode for all supported eigen problems.

BUG FIXES

    o Update arpack-ng to 3.1.4





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.3-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Now eigs() supports real symmetric matrices.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.2-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Now eigs() supports sparse real nonsymmetric matrices of the class
      "dgCMatrix", defined in the Matrix package.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.1-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Initial version. For now eigs() supports dense real nonsymmetric matrices.
